Hello,

Here is where I will document what I've learned upon completing this project!


I built a simple website with four pages. One homepage, and three subsequent pages with featured recipes. I added links to these pages from the homepage, as well as pictures of the dishes. I listed the ingredients and the cooking instructions in unordered and ordered list formats, respectively. Lastly, I experimented with the Strong tag and multiple heading tags.  

Best,
Tory
